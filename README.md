# Description

A minimal app (just a simple button), but where I could learn some very interesting programming concepts, including some functional stuff, like:
- function composition
- point-free style
- monads
- the publisher/subscriber pattern

# Start me up

1. Start the server
`npm run serve`

2. Open the file public/index.html on your web browser
