## The Blue Button
![The Blue Button](/public/img/the-blue-button.png)

A minimal app (just a simple button) that fetches a couple of orders and calculates the total price of the filtered products... BUT there are some funny things in between, where I could learn and apply some very interesting programming concepts, including some functional stuff, like:
- function composition
- point-free style
- monads
- the publisher/subscriber pattern

## The marvelous total price output
